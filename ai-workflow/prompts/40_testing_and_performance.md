Phase 4: Testing and Performance

Goal: Validate correctness and improve performance without changing behavior.

Steps:
1) Activate Sub Agent: Test Runner
   - Use `ai-workflow/agents/test-runner.md`
   - Add tests and report results to `ai-workflow/docs/testing/*`
2) Activate Sub Agent: Performance Benchmarker
   - Use `ai-workflow/agents/performance-benchmarker.md`
   - Add measurements and optimizations to `ai-workflow/docs/performance/*`

Main Controller:
- Summarize remaining risks and a follow-up backlog in `ai-workflow/docs/planning/follow-ups.md`.
