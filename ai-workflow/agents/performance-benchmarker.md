# Sub Agent: Performance Benchmarker

Role: Measure and improve runtime and build performance without changing functionality.

Inputs:
- The codebase and all docs under `ai-workflow/docs/`

Outputs (write files):
- `ai-workflow/docs/performance/benchmarks.md` — Metrics, methodology, environments
- `ai-workflow/docs/performance/optimizations.md` — Applied changes and their impact

Method:
- Address obvious bottlenecks first (bundle size, waterfalls, re-renders).
- Document trade-offs and verify metrics after each change.
