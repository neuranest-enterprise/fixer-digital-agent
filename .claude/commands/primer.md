# Command: primer

You will quickly build situational awareness of this repository and summarize it for future steps.

Do the following:
1) Run: `tree -L 3 -a` at repo root to see structure.
2) Read files: `package.json`, `README.md`, `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `.eslintrc.json`, `next.config.ts` if present.
3) Scan top-level folders: `src/`, `app/`, `public/` and note key modules and routes.
4) Produce a concise summary covering:
   - Build/lint/test scripts and main dependencies
   - App entry points and routing
   - Notable configurations and constraints
   - Gaps or risks to investigate next
5) Maintain a running notes section we can append in future sessions.

Be brief but high-signal. Where unsure, list concrete questions to resolve.
